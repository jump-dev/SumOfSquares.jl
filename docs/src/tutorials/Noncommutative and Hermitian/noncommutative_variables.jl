# ## Example 2.11
#
# We consider the Example 2.11 of [BKP16] in which the polynomial with noncommutative variables
# $(x * y + x^2)^2 = x^4 + x^3y + xyx^2 + xyxy$ is tested to be sum-of-squares.

p = (x * y + x^2)^2

# We first need to pick an SDP solver, see [here](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.6/installation/#Supported-solvers) for a list of the available choices.

using SumOfSquares
import CSDP
optimizer_constructor = optimizer_with_attributes(CSDP.Optimizer, MOI.Silent() => true)
model = Model(optimizer_constructor)
con_ref = @constraint(model, p in SOSCone())

optimize!(model)

# We see that both the monomials `xy` and `yx` are considered separately, this is a difference with the commutative version.

certificate_basis(con_ref)

# We see that the solution correctly uses the monomial `xy` instead of `yx`. We also identify that only the monomials `x^2` and `xy` would be needed. This would be dectected by the Newton chip method of [Section 2.3, BKP16].

# When asking for the SOS decomposition, the numerically small entries makes the solution less readable.

# They are however easily discarded by using a nonzero tolerance:

dec = sos_decomposition(con_ref, 1e-6)                    #src
@test length(dec.ps) == 1                                 #src

sos_decomposition(con_ref, 1e-6)       #!src

# ## Example 2.2
#
# We consider now the Example 2.2 of [BKP16] in which the polynomial with noncommutative variables
# $(x + x^{10}y^{20}x^{10})^2$ is tested to be sum-of-squares.

# Only two monomials were considered for the basis of the gram matrix thanks to the Augmented Newton chip method detailed in [Section 2.4, BKP16].

# The polynomial `p = x^2 - x*y^2 + y^4 + 1` is SOS.
# We can, for example, decompose it as
# `p = 3/4*(x - y^2)^2 + 1/4*(x + y)^2 + 1`,
# which clearly proves that `p` is SOS, and there are infinitely many other ways
# to decompose `p` into sums of squares.

# We can use SumOfSquares.jl to find such decompositions.

# First, setup the polynomial of interest.

@polyvar x y
p = x^2 - x*y^2 + y^4 + 1

# Secondly, constrain the polynomial to be nonnegative.
# SumOfSquares.jl transparently reinterprets polyonmial nonnegativity as the
# appropriate SOS certificate for polynomials nonnegative on semialgebraic sets.

model = SOSModel(CSDP.Optimizer)
@constraint(model, cref, p >= 0)

# Thirdly, optimize the feasibility problem!

optimize!(model)

# Lastly, recover a SOS decomposition.
# In general, SOS decompositions are not unique!

sos_dec = sos_decomposition(cref, 1e-4)

# Converting, rounding, and simplifying - Huzza, Back where we began!

polynomial(sos_dec, Float32)

# ## A deeper explanation and the unexplained `1e-4` parameter

# `p = x^2 - x*y^2 + y^4 + 1` can be represented in terms of its Gram matrix as

gram = gram_matrix(cref)

#-

gram.basis.monomials' * gram.Q * gram.basis.monomials

# where the matrix `gram.Q` is positive semidefinite, because `p` is SOS. If we
# could only get the decomposition `gram.Q = V' * V`, the SOS decomposition would
# simply be `||V * monomials||^2`.

# Unfortunately, we can not use Cholesky decomposition, since gram `Q` is only
# semidefinite, not definite. Hence, SumOfSquares.jl uses SVD decomposition
# instead and discards small singular values (in our case `1e-4`).

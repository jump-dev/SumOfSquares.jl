# Given a Sum-of-Squares constraint on an algebraic set:
# ```math
# g_1(x) = , \ldots, g_m(x) = 0 \Rightarrow p(x) \ge 0.
# ```
# We can either use the certificate:
# ```math
# p(x) = s(x) + \lambda_1(x) g_1(x) + \cdots + \lambda_m(x) g_m(x), s_0(x) \text{ is SOS},
# ```
# or
# ```math
# p(x) \equiv s(x) \pmod{\la g_1(x), \ldots, g_m(x) \ra}, s_0(x) \text{ is SOS}.
# ```
# the second one leads to a *simpler* SDP but needs to compute a *Gr\"obner* basis:
#  * SemialgebraicSets implements Buchberger's algorithm.
#  * The `@set` macro recognizes variable fix, e.g., `x = 1`
#     and provides shortcut.
#  * If you know a \alert{better} way to take modulo,
#    better create your \alert{own} type of algebraic set!

# We illustrate this in this example.

S = algebraicset([xi^2 - 1 for xi in x])

# We will now search for the minimum of `x` over `S` using Sum of Squares Programming.
# We first need to pick an SDP solver, see [here](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v1.8/installation/#Supported-solvers) for a list of the available choices.

# Note that the minimum is in fact `1`.
# Indeed, since each variables is odd (it is either `-1` or `1`)
# and there is an odd number of variables, their sum is odd.
# Therefore it cannot be zero!

# We can see that the Gröbner basis of `S` was computed

@show S.I.gröbnerbasis
S.I.algo

# The Gröbner basis is simple to compute in this case as the vector
# of `xi^2 - 1` is already a Gröbner basis.
# However, we still need to divide polynomials by the Gröbner basis
# which can be simplified in this case.
